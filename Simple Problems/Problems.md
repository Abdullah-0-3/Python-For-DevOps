# Python Practice Problems

I am working to improve my programming logic. Coding can be done by AI, but logic is developed by practicing problems. I donâ€™t create these problems on my own.

I am solving problems from **Computer Science Practical Notebook for Class 10**. These problems are written in C language, but I will solve them in Python. It feels exciting! ðŸŽ‰
